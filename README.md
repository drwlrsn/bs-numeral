# bs-numeral
[BuckleScript](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript) bindings for [Numeral.js](https://numeraljs.com/).

## Status

This is a work in progress and my first crack at ReasonML/Bucklescript. Proceed with caution -- like a lot of it.

## Special thanks
- [Jiayu Liu](https://github.com/Jimexist) and the [bs-moment](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-moment) repo.
- bsansouci on ReasonML Discord for showing me GADTs (which I still only kinda get).
